Hello! My name is Tyler and I'm a full-stack developer.

Currently, I work with an awesome team at Raymond James in Fixed Income Technology. We use Typescript and Angular with a C# back-end and ODB and MSSQL to build and extend custom applications for our traders, brokers, analysts, and auditors. My favorite part of any day is writing a clean, performant, and reusable snippet. I love  identifying a good-enough solution and refactoring it into a great one with the help of my team members.

In 2021, I graduated from the University of Memphis with my PhD in Computer Science. My research interests include the self-assembly of complex systems, computational geometry, and the probabilistic analysis of stochastic processes with applications in bioinformatics and molecular computing. For my dissertation, I presented a novel model of self-assembly called the synoptic pattern and demonstrated its use in the probabilistic analysis of the long-term behavior of self-assembly systems.

In my free time, I enjoy learning about new technologies, playing tabletop games, and hiking.

I love collaborating with other passionate people on interesting projects. Please contact me through my website to start the conversation!
